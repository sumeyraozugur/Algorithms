# Algorithms
## What is an Algorithm?🌿
✨A step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to solve a specific problem. 


<b>Code Complexity</b> = Time Complexity + Space Complexity 

Time Complexity -> How long does our code take to execute?

Space Complexity ->  How much space does our code occupy in memory?

<b>Big O: </b>Defines how the usage of resources, such as execution time or memory, grows in relation to the size of the data.

❗️Big O is always calculated by considering the worst-case scenario.

O(1)   ➡ Constant  </br>
O(n)   ➡ Linear  </br>
O(n²)  ➡ Quadratic  </br>
log(n) ➡Logarithmic  </br>
nlog(n) ➡ Log Linear  </br>
O(n³)  ➡ Cubic  </br>
O(n!)  ➡ Factorial  </br>
O(2^n) ➡ Exponential  </br>
